## Project Title

Squad List

## Project Description.

The purpose of this assignment is to gain practical experience in understanding and
implementing responsive layouts that display information using card components.
This exercise will help students learn how to create flexible and adaptive layouts
that work effectively across different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user
experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
You are expected to create a responsive webpage that displays the squad list of a
sports team. You may choose any team sport, such as football, handball, basketball,
etc., but not an individual sport. For example, you could feature the squad list of
Norway’s national football team or handball team, or any other football, handball,
or basketball team that interests you.
• The information about each player should be displayed in a card.
• Each card should include an image of the player and at least three pieces of
information, such as age, nationality, jersey number, position, previous clubs,
etc. about that specific player.
• There should be a minimum of 15 cards displayed on the page.
Feel free to check the official websites of the teams you're working with for guidance.
Observing how these sites display squad lists and league tables can offer useful
ideas for your own design. Just be sure that your final work is original and meets
the requirements of the project.
